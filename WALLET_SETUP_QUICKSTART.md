# 🎯 Quick Start: Native Wallet Connections

## ✅ What I Fixed

**Problem:** Wallets opened in new browser tabs (bad UX)  
**Solution:** Wallets now open **natively in app** (like clicking a phone number opens dialer)

---

## 🚀 Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Get WalletConnect ID (FREE)
```bash
# Open this in browser:
https://cloud.walletconnect.com

# 1. Sign up (GitHub/email)
# 2. Create project: "PaySmile"
# 3. Copy your Project ID
```

### Step 2: Update Environment
```bash
# Edit .env.local
nano .env.local

# Replace this line:
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=demo-project-id-replace-me

# With your real ID:
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=abc123def456...
```

### Step 3: Test It!
```bash
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:9002/connect
# Click "WalletConnect" button
# Your wallet app opens automatically! 🎉
```

## 📱 How It Works Now
