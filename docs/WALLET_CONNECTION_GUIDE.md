# üì± Native Wallet Connection Guide

## ‚úÖ What Changed

Your wallet connection now **opens natively in wallet apps** instead of browser tabs!

### Before ‚ùå

- Clicked "Connect Wallet"
- Opened new browser tab/window
- Had to manually switch between apps

### After ‚úÖ

- Click "Connect Wallet"
- **Wallet app opens automatically** (TrustWallet, Valora, MetaMask)
- Approve connection in native app
- Returns to PaySmile automatically

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### Technology: WalletConnect v2

WalletConnect creates a **direct connection** between your web app and mobile wallet apps using:

1. **Deep Links** - Opens wallet apps natively (like clicking a phone number opens the dialer)
2. **QR Codes** - Desktop users can scan with mobile wallet
3. **End-to-end encryption** - Secure connection between app and wallet

### Supported Wallets

‚úÖ **Mobile-First (Recommended)**

- **Valora** (Best for Celo - built specifically for it)
- **TrustWallet** (Popular, supports 100+ chains)
- **MetaMask Mobile** (Most popular overall)
- **Rainbow Wallet** (Beautiful UX)
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- **Argent** (Smart wallet)

‚úÖ **Browser Extensions** (Fallback)

- MetaMask browser extension
- Coinbase Wallet extension
- Any injected wallet

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Required

### Step 1: Get WalletConnect Project ID (FREE!)

1. Go to: https://cloud.walletconnect.com
2. Click "Sign Up" (free forever)
3. Create a new project:
   - Name: `PaySmile`
   - Description: `Round up your transactions and donate`
4. Copy your **Project ID**

### Step 2: Add to Environment Variables

```bash
# Edit .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
```

Replace `demo-project-id-replace-me` with your real project ID.

**Current status:** Using demo ID (works but limited)  
**Production:** MUST use your own project ID

### Step 3: Test It!

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Open http://localhost:9002 on your computer
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. You'll see two options:
   - **WalletConnect** - For mobile wallets (opens native app)
   - **Injected** - For browser extensions (MetaMask, etc.)

## üîß Code Changes Made

### 1. WagmiProvider.tsx

**Added WalletConnect connector:**

```typescript
import { walletConnect } from "wagmi/connectors";

const config = createConfig({
  connectors: [
    // Primary: WalletConnect (native apps)
    walletConnect({
      projectId: "your-id",
      showQrModal: true, // Desktop QR scanning
    }),
    // Fallback: Browser extensions
    injected(),
  ],
});
```

**How it works:**

- Tries WalletConnect first (mobile apps)
- Falls back to injected wallets (browser extensions)
- Users choose which connector to use

### 2. Connect Page (connect/page.tsx)

**Shows available connectors:**

```typescript
const { connectors, connect } = useConnect();

// User sees buttons for each connector:
// üì± WalletConnect (opens native app)
// ü¶ä MetaMask (browser extension)
```

### 3. Environment Variables

**Added to .env.local:**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=demo-project-id-replace-me
```
