## 🎬 **SCENE 1: Problem Statement (0:00 - 0:45)**

### Visual: Uganda Mobile Payment Stats + Pain Points

**Narrator:**

> "In Uganda, over 30 million mobile money transactions happen every single day. People buy airtime for 1,950 shillings, pay for goods worth 4,750 shillings, or send money across the country.
>
> But here's the problem: Those small amounts of spare change - 50 shillings here, 250 there - they add up to millions, yet they never go toward building our communities.
>
> Why? Because people don't trust where donations go. There's no transparency. And they think 50 shillings is too small to make a difference.
>
> What if we could turn every payment into an opportunity to build a better Uganda?"

**Screen Text:**

- 30M+ mobile payments daily in Uganda
- Millions in spare change unused
- Zero transparency in traditional donations
- Communities struggle to raise funds

## 🎬 **SCENE 2: Introducing PaySmile (0:45 - 1:30)**

**Narrator:**

> "Meet PaySmile - where small payments create big smiles.
>
> PaySmile is a blockchain-powered mobile app built on Celo that turns your everyday transactions into community impact.
>
> Here's how it works:
>
> When you buy airtime for 1,950 shillings, PaySmile rounds it up to 2,000. That extra 50 shillings? It becomes a micro-donation to verified community projects - clean water wells, school supplies, tree planting.
>
> Every donation is recorded on the blockchain, so you can see exactly where your money goes. No middlemen. No corruption. Just pure impact.
>
> And to make giving fun, you earn digital NFT badges for every contribution - verified proof of your generosity that lives on the blockchain forever."

### Visual: Dashboard showing aggregate impact

**Narrator:**

> "Now imagine this at scale.
>
> If 10,000 Ugandans round up just 100 shillings per day, that's 1 million shillings daily - over 30 million per month going straight to community projects.
>
> With PaySmile's transparent voting system, communities choose what matters most to them. Water wells in rural areas. School supplies for underfunded classrooms. Trees to fight climate change.
>
> Everything is tracked on Celo's blockchain - every vote, every donation, every project milestone. No corruption. Complete transparency.
>
> And because we're built on Celo, it's mobile-first, low-cost, and perfect for Africa's growing Web3 ecosystem."
